# 📚 STRATOS Glossary  
**Key Terms, Frameworks, and Modular Intelligence Vocabulary**

This glossary provides consistent definitions and mental anchors for the language used across the STRATOS system. It will evolve alongside STRATOS maturity — supporting clarity, reuse, and intelligent orchestration.

---

## 🔠 A–Z Terms

### **STRATOS**  
*Strategic Operating System for Transformation, Orchestration & Scale*  
A modular framework that turns ideas into intelligent tools and scalable outcomes. STRATOS connects frameworks, co-pilot agents, lifecycle logic, and execution systems.

---

### **SYNAPSE**  
*System for Navigating AI-Powered Strategy & Execution*  
The modular intelligence layer within STRATOS. Hosts and orchestrates co-pilot agents across lifecycle stages.

---

### **SYNTRA**  
*SYNthesize + TRAction*  
A thinking system that supports strategic synthesis, friction discovery, and idea traction across transformation projects.

---

### **FUSE**  
*Framework for Unified Strategic Execution*  
STRATOS' execution governance layer — managing project design, decision logic, and delivery pathways.

---

### **UPTRIX**  
*Unleashing Potential Through Reflexive Incremental eXpertise*  
A learning and capability-growth module for lifelong digital fluency and agent-powered upskilling.

---

### **KLAY**  
*Kinetic Layout Architect for You*  
A modular front-end co-pilot designed to build intelligent, branded, and scalable UIs using tools like Streamlit and TailwindCSS.

---

### **BLOM**  
*“Scout, Seed, Scale”*  
A signal intelligence assistant that scouts digital pulse, trends, and sentiment patterns to inspire new opportunities.

## 🤖 Co-Pilot Agents (via SYNAPSE)

| Agent     | Role | N-DEPTH Phase | Description |
|-----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| **OPTRIX**  | Opportunity Mapper | N: Navigate the Need | Identifies and structures digitalization opportunities from friction |
| **ARCHYX**  | System Architect   | D: Design the Solution | Converts briefs into solution blueprints and stack plans |
| **ENGENA**  | Code Constructor   | E: Engineer the Prototype | Builds Python automation projects from structured plans |
| **LAUNIX**  | Rollout Strategist | P: Pilot & Deploy | Packages tools, creates SOPs, and prepares deployment |
| **EVOLIX**  | Continuity Engine  | TH: Tune & Harvest | Monitors usage, triggers improvement, and sustains tool evolution |

---

### **N-DEPTH Lifecycle**  
A structured lifecycle model that governs transformation from idea to impact:

- **N**: Navigate the Need  
- **D**: Design the Solution  
- **E**: Engineer the Prototype  
- **P**: Pilot and Deploy  
- **TH**: Tune, Harvest, and Scale

---

### **YAML Briefs**  
Structured handoff formats used across agents (e.g., `opportunity_block.yaml`, `project.yaml`, `improvement_backlog.yaml`). YAML ensures reusability, machine-readability, and interoperability.

---

### **Manifestation**  
A domain-specific deployment of a SYNAPSE agent or workflow — tailored for specific environments, roles, or industries.

---

### **Co-Pilot**  
A modular intelligence unit (GPT or logic script) that performs a role in the transformation lifecycle. Co-pilots follow behavior protocols, trigger phrases, and YAML I/O.

---

### **MiniStack**  
A lightweight build or simulation of the STRATOS agent ecosystem — either using GPT Actions (cloud) or Ollama + LangGraph (local).

---

### **Modular Intelligence**  
The design principle that powers STRATOS: agents, stacks, and outputs can be plugged together or used independently — enabling tailored transformation journeys.

---

### **SYNERGY Layer**  
An implicit personalization layer in STRATOS — ensuring outputs, UI, and logic align with user context, goals, and system behavior.
